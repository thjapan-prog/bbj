Even a she-dragon would tremble in its presence. This one lass asked to catch a glimpse of my holy sword, so I booked a room and told her to bring some booze for the occasion. | No, I really saw it with my own eyes. Two unholds tangled together, being intimate. Honestly, I don\'t know which one is the female. Hell, they might both be males for all I know. The moans they made were louder and dirtier than the sound of my poop after holding it in for a week. | If it has a chicken head and a lion body, is it a griffin? Or a cockatrice? I wonder what the meat will taste like. It\'s gotta be a taste worth risking your fucking life for, isn\'t it? | Northern barbarians are bad at drinking. After drinking a glass of basilisk ale, he vomited everything in his stomach and begged me to save him, Fuck. Southern assholes don\'t know much about alcohol or women, so it\'s not worth talking about. | Yes, yes, he was such an asshole. One time he tried to do that to a dead undead bitch. That bastard is a crazy bastard who just fuck in any hole. The reason he got sick recently is probably because he fucked a dead Unhold\'s asshole. | Wizards are untrustworthy people. Have you ever seen them sleeping with women? They say a wizard must never have sexual intercourse to maintain his mystical powers. But I think differently. To satisfy their desires, they secretly kidnap female horses every night to satisfy their dirty desires and suck out their life force. Just like a Necrosavant. Did I see it with my own eyes? Do you believe and pray to God because you have seen him with your own eyes? | Last time it was really bad. I was so fucking drunk that I slept with a fucking old hag. When I woke up that day, I thought I had woken up in a graveyard next to a skeleton. It was the worst fucking day of my life. Luckily I didn't stick my dick in a horse or a melon. If that were the case, I would have committed suicide. What? She wasn\'t even a woman? Fuck, I guess I should commit suicide. | You don\'t know anything. If you fuck a man\'s backdoor once, you\'ll never be able to fuck a woman again. What? You think I\'m going to fuck my brothers? Fuck it, I have eyes too. Don\'t even dream about it because I won\'t put it in your dirty asshole. | My first experience? It was fun to play with my hands while looking at the sexy female {horse | cow | goat | dog | cat}\'s {ass | pussy}. One time, while I was having a good time, my {mom | dad | brother | sister} saw me. Since then my life has been messed up and now I\'m making money by killing people, fuck. | A life like drinking, fuck women, and making babies is not fun. I feel alive only on the battlefield. Nothing can match the pleasure I get when I see my enemy dying at the crossroads between life and death where my life is at stake. That\'s why I can\'t stop doing this. | What does retirement mean to me, the {Lonely | Warlike | Ruthless | Invincible | Cold} {Adventurer | Gambler | Widowmaker | Hunter | Wolf | Slayer}? {Marrying a regular woman and having children with the money I\'ve saved, then dying in bed like a commoner. | Meeting a strong opponent on the battlefield and die great after a fierce battle. | Standing there with a shit eating grin as the boss who watches over us fires me, that\'s retirement.} But I\'m more curious about whether the crappy food I ate yesterday will be served again tonight than about life after retirement.}%SPEECH_OFF%%randombrother% was chatting excitedly in front of the campfire.
