She takes a few steps towards you, reveals a wicked smile, then spins on her heels. With a primal howl and mighty rap of her shield, she charges into the mass of flesh, sending a ripple through the meagre formation that sends some children crashing into the muck, with others immediately shattering and turning tail. A few shoves, hollers, and feinted strikes later, and the crusade had been thoroughly killed in its crib- children lay amongst the dirt groaning, others begin to snivel and loudly doubt their holy mission. %shieldmaiden% ends her assault almost as quick as she started it, planting her shield to the floor to offer a hand to the leader of the now broken army. Lifting him up, the ranks begin to reform around your now placated shieldmaiden, and she continues.%SPEECH_ON%See, my brave warriors. Such foes are not to be trifled with at such a tender age. Savages would not show mercy as I have, nor would they give such warning. Together, we can beat them, but for now you would all do better to go home and train, grow- become strong! In time, perhaps I will find you in my shieldwall, side to side as we bring the old gods to that godless land.%SPEECH_OFF%The leader, at first crestfallen from his troop\'s blistering destruction, is renewed with a vigour that could only be childlike naivety. He turns to his host and echoes the shieldmaiden, telling the children that they will serve the old gods in time, but for now they need to practice and prepare themselves. Like a horde of ants, the children begin to spill away in their singular purpose back down the road. %shieldmaiden% returns to you, visibly pleased with her instruction, although perhaps she just enjoyed the mock beatdown. A few of the company applaud her \'hands on\' lesson, others muse at how long such a rabble would have lasted had she not scared them off.
