The town was destroyed, but not a soul was lost. | He spent many years preparing trophies for royalty until a fashion faux pas led his being exiled. | Unfortunately, a man collecting parts of dead animals, as %name% is wont to do, left the taxidermist ostracized from many a village. | He tried to make his break in the big cities, but sadly he just could not compete with the other taxidermists. | When a lord organized an army, %name% handled the trinkets, giving the soldiers wards and potions. | But a fierce competition between taxidermists led to a preserved and stuffed deadman and %name% coincidentally leaving his shop behind. | Sadly, robbers ransacked his shop and, with the wars going on, it would be impossible to restock. | But when he sheared a sheep that did not belong to him, %name% was kicked out of town. | He once choked out a would-be thief with a cord of measuring wire. So he says, anyway. | But working for unlikeable and unfriendly nobility eventually {bored him. | wore on him.} | Once tasked with stuffing a particularly impressive beast, %name% wondered what the outside world was really like. | Designing a trophy adorned with teh results of {epic quests | epic feats}, %name% wondered if maybe he should be the one they wove stories about.} Now the taxidermist looks for a new life, no matter where it takes him. {Maybe he can create trophies to protect the unit, or something. | He\'s particular and peculiar, peppering everyone with questions about their trophies. | He\'s no natural soldier, but he appraises each kill as if assessing it to hang on a wall. | The way he measures and calculates for trophies, it\'s too bad %name% wasn\'t a siege engineer. | While hardly a soldier, %name%\'s familiarity with gutting beasts should come in handy. | %name%\'s knowledge of beasts is seriously impressive. | A bit on the nimbly-pimbly side, %name% has the gut cutting skills of swordfighter, but the swordfighting of a soft breeze. | %name% would seem very out of place in a suit of armor, but boy is he going to need one. | As it turns out, %name% can in fact make a silk purse out of a sow\'s ear. | Don\'t let his vocation fool you, %name% is more deft with his hands than some {cardsharks | jugglers | pickpockets}. | Taxidermists don\'t seem fit for combat, but then again neither do most of the men you run across these days. | A taxidermist seems ill-fit for combat, but cutting up beasts is an uncommon skill. | With an eye {for beast innards | for trophies}, %name% is a lot smarter than he lets on at first glance.}";
