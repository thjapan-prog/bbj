You wonder aloud about what is inside and the smith, seemingly taken aback by your curiosity, explains that the market was trying to pass off a bunch of junk as weapons and armor. He goes on to say that he bought it with intent to salvage so he could use the scraps to repair some equipment brought in by another patron. With your curiosity sated, you leave with new ideas in your head.\n\n%description%",
