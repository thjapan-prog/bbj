Now %they%\'ll have to remember keeping the shield wall as arrows rain down on it. | Ironically, %name% has never written anything in %their% life. | Rolling up %their% sleeves, %name% boasts %they% has one last message to give the world. Everybody look out. | Perhaps %their% joining mercenaries suggests that, indeed, the pen is not mightier than a sword. | %name% has a tendency to repeat everything said to %them%. Old messenger habits die hard. | Ironically, the well-traveled messenger has probably seen more horrors on the road than most of the men in the outfit. | Few, if any, of %name%\'s skills make %them% ready for combat.
