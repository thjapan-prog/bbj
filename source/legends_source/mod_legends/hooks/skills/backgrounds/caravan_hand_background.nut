After an intense argument with the woman, %name% thought it better to leave before he did something awful. | One day, goods went missing and the hand was blamed for it, promptly ending his time with the caravan. | But a caravan needs protection for a reason, and an ambush by brigands proved why. %name% barely made it out alive. | Years on the road went without a hitch until a new caravan master refused to pay %name%. With just one hand the caravanner punched his boss and grabbed his wages. He used both legs to run, though. | Caravans are frequently tense places to be. One fateful evening, in a dispute over gambling debts, he stove in the head of another traveler. Fearing retribution, %name% was gone before morning. | Sadly, with the expanding war the caravan\'s profits were marginal. %name% was let go as the merchants retired their wagons. | After seeing the foul work of beasts on a fellow caravan, it didn\'t take long for %name% to figure out his wages didn\'t quite meet the level of threats around him. | But war deprived the caravan of stock and soon its driver took to selling slaves. Appalled, %name% freed as many as he could before leaving for good. | Sadly, his caravan began to sell human chattel. While the profits were enormous, it garnered the attention of a local militia - and their pitchforks. One ambush later and %name% was running for his life.} {Now uncertain of what to do, he seeks any opportunity that might come by. | A man like %name% is no stranger to danger, making him a good fit for any mercenary group. | With his caravan days behind him, working as a sellsword was just another avenue for adventure and profit. | In %name%\'s mind, being a mercenary is a lot like being a caravanner. Just better paid. | Well versed to traveling, %name% seems like a natural fit to the tasks already befit for a mercenary. | Years of road travel have molded %name% into quite the durable figure. Any group of mercenaries could use more men like him.}";
