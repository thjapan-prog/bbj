Masked by green silk, nearly see through, and clothed in thin silks with the whole midriff exposed, the dancer is no doubt an expert in her field. She whirls, hips hypnotic, elbows bowed, hands clapping little cymbals, her feet tiptoeing as she spins a spot so tight there very well may be an invisible god above holding her in place as she razzles and dazzles.\n\n Someone throws an apple through the air and the dancer spins around and shoots a tiny dagger through it, plugging it dead center and dropping the fruit to the ground. Another apple soars in and this time a large saber is produced and slashes the stem off and she catches the rest and takes a bite. The crowd claps gently to this.}";

She claps the cymbals in your face, then swings around, briefly bumping you with her hips, and starts to dance back to the middle.

She drops, bowlegged, and sinks to the ground like a collapsing truss. She counts her crowns.%SPEECH_ON%I\'m not sure if you have a good eye for the wandering nature of ones such as myself.

Now, I know you are merely petting things which shall make me purr, preying upon my pride as the hunter does the lions, and I will say this: it has worked. I will fight for you, captain of the Crownlings, and I will fight well.%SPEECH_OFF%Nodding, you ask that she lower the blade. She spins it in her hand and sheathes it in one swift motion. She gets to her feet and dresses in a more sturdy outfit.%SPEECH_ON%This life I will leave behind in total, and to the Crownling\'s life I will be devoted in whole.%SPEECH_OFF%You shake the woman\'s hand. Just at that moment, a leering passerby struts over and attempts to clutch her by her hips. Without as much as a glance nor warning, she throws a knife out of nowhere, landing point first in a pole right next to the passerby\'s hips.

I just wanted to dance!%SPEECH_OFF%Finally turning to face him, her expression darkens into a foreboding smile%SPEECH_ON% How uncouth! You\'d best be careful what you ask for.
