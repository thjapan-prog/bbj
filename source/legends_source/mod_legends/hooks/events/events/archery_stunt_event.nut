An apple rests on one mercenary\'s head, while the other is walking away - a bow in hand.\n\nYou ask %otherguy% what is going on, who explains that the two are going to try some sort of stunt or trick that involves shooting a piece of fruit off a person\'s head.

The mercenary screams. The crowd oohs. %archer% slowly lowers the bow and looks at it as though it is at fault.\n\n Eventually, %clown% is carried past you, a shaft of an arrow sticking out of their head.

The company are exchanging bets on whether or not the archer misses. You want to look away, but the spectacle truly is too much.\n\n A great gasp follows the arrow\'s release, as though some ominous event long foretold had finally happened. Mercenaries reel back in their seats, wincing and gritting their teeth. The apple is shot off %clown%\'s head, fruit and arrow spinning away. After a brief silence, the company erupts in cheers. %clown% takes a bow, while %archer% slackens draw and looks a bit relieved.";
