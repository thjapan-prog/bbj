The houndmaster frequently remained in the rearguard, crouched low, hands at %their_houndmaster% side, locking eyes with the lone wolf for minutes on end. But today, using a bit of leftover meat, %they_houndmaster% plied the beast right into the middle of the camp. Now %they_houndmaster% squats at its side, dwarfed by its prominent, muscled withers, its pointed and attentive ears, and a lapping maw lined with mankilling canines.\n\n The rest of the men stand behind their weapons. One yells at the houndmaster to stop what %they_houndmaster% is doing. Another says the wolf can smell fear. Yet another throws a rock at it. The wolf winces, but doesn\'t react. Laughing, the houndmaster makes a \'tssst!\' noise and points. The wolf launches forward, picking up the stone and bringing it back to the %person_houndmaster%. %They_houndmaster% rubs the beast\'s mane.%SPEECH_ON%See, easily trained, just like any dog. Only bigger, faster, and stronger. Smarter, too.%SPEECH_OFF%Its eyes meet yours. The wolf lays low, almost like a man bowing. %houndmaster% laughs again.%SPEECH_ON%See? It already knows who is alpha of this pack.%SPEECH_OFF%";
