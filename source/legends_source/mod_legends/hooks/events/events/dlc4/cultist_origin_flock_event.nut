After a time advocating for Davkul\'s purpose, the argument has been made and yourself engendered to it all the same. %joiner% joins the company. | Davkul surely watches over you as a devotee by the name of %joiner% joins the %companyname%. Stating but one purpose, and it was to find you and ensure that this world sees all that awaits it. | %joiner% says they saw the shadows flicker behind your body as though they were \'of flame.\' %joiner% declaring to join your cause for surely Davkul has embedded in you an aspect of the dark and infinite. | %joiner% walks beside you, calling you an aspect of Davkul\'s darkness, and that eternal eyes surely watch over your party whole. The %companyname% takes %joiner% beneath its many shadowed wings. | %joiner% finds the %companyname% on the march and joins its ranks as though no stranger at all. No one says a word and you simply direct %joiner% to the inventory where the purpose may gather teeth. | With a showing of a scarred head, %joiner% claims to be at the speartip of Davkul\'s purpose. You nod and welcome %joiner% into the %companyname%. | Walking in the shadow of Davkul, you were bound to find folk such as %joiner%. Keen on joining the company, in particular because you are in command of it, and more particularly due to a belief Davkul has chosen you. | %joiner% bands with the company and there is little argument as to why. When asked where %joiner% came from, there is a shrug and talk of Davkul while nodding knowingly in your direction.}";
