Apparently the %formerbeggar% just needs a little more, expressing a longwinded sob story to anyone who\'ll listen. Hearing this news, you go to see the %person_beggar% yourself but before you can even get a word out the %person_beggar% lets loose %their_beggar% long narrative. Finished, %they_beggar% looks you in the eye, trying to gauge whether or not you\'ll give %them_beggar% something. | Apparently %beggar% the former beggar needs some help. %They_beggar%\'s come to you, begging for a few crowns to help %them_beggar% get by.
