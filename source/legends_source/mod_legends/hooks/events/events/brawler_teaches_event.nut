Predictably, the assault is aimless and pitiful. Long, looping punches are thrown with no energy behind them. The brawler ducks and weaves out of the way, punching every attempted strike with a counter-punch of %their_brawler% own.%SPEECH_ON%See what happens when you are tired? This is why we must train.

The trainee bowls over and is kicked in the shoulder repeatedly until managing to stand back up.\n\nThere the brawler continues to circle and deliver blows. Not every strike is thrown with conviction: most are meant to inflict pain, but not what could be called irreversible damage. The brawler, if %they_brawler% wanted to, could kill this mercenary with %their_brawler% bare fists, but that is not the purpose of this training.
