Digging trenches, stripping corpses, and making said corpses dominate the daily unlife of this walking cadaver. | Filling the disposable ranks of the Legion\'s many slaves, their work is dominated with manual and violent tasks to ensure the unimpeded task of the machine-like Legion. | As one of many faceless slaves within the Legion, they fill the role of the disposable body to throw at problems — fighting, carrying of supplies, and their eventual destruction are vital parts of their role. | Providing comforts to the rest of the Legion at the expense of their own, the work of a Legion slave is one of never-ending toil and torment. | The often unseen labour behind the Legion\'s frightening efficiency, the labouring slave shares no glory and wins no accolades for its success, but is first to suffer setbacks both on and off the battlefield.} {If %name%'s face had any flesh or human features left, it would betray unspeakable sadness and desperation in the face of their endless torment. Instead, a cold and hollow skull hides such inconveniences, only presenting as ready for more orders. | Despite their station, %name% wears a misplaced enthusiasm to serve and better their situation, tricked by their own delusion that eventually, their toils will end, and they will rise through the Legion as a respected figure. | Fearing the ever-present judgement of their betters, %name% toils with a fervour that threatens to break apart their fragile frame. | The resignation to their fate is clear in how %name% carries themself. Aware of their nature within the Legion\'s endless campaign, they seemingly await their destruction to return them to the earth, were they so lucky. | Having spent little time in their station, the almost eager demeanour of %name% is likely to be short lived.
