Back from beyond, the mission has changed, but their zeal to serve persists. | Few would suspect %name%'s humble roots given their status as one of the finest commanders in the Empire. What life they had before however is long gone, and now, only the Legion remains. | Few would suspect %name%'s humble roots given their status as one of the finest commanders in the Empire. What life they had before however is long gone, and now, only the Legion remains. | Death could not stop %name%. As one of the Empire's most decorated commanders, in ages past their reputation would precede them. Now, they seek to restore their fearsome title as both a leader and killer of men. | To plan, execute, adapt, and triumph in the face of great adversity is %name%'s speciality. Having whet their teeth against some of the Empire's toughest foes, they answer the call for one final mission.} {Even in undeath, %name% wears numerous scars down to the bone. | %name% wears their armour as if it were a second skin. | %name% has an aura of authority about them. | %name% has a commanding presence, even when not on the battlefield. | %name% has witnessed many battles with the scars to prove it.} {Leading from the front, this centurion stands as an inspiring beacon to the Legion, and a terrible demon to its foes. Leading groups of soldiers in extended combats, they can be trusted to fight to the end, and beyond. | Centurions are responsible for commanding troops in battle. Seasoned, grizzled, and beyond loyal, they represent the best of the Empire's fighting troops. Death has little chance of stopping them. | The life of a centurion is one of mixed administration and combat leadership. From directing work around camp, to launching a raid on the enemy's, a centurion's work is dynamic and vital to the Legion's success. | Few men have the mettle for what being a Legion centurion entails. An artist on the battlefield, they paint with troop movements and battle tactics, creating masterpieces of imperial ingenuity, signed with a swathe of enemy dead. | Soldiers need orders. The centurion provides direction and determination to the ranks, leading battles and facing the enemy head-on. | They keep a keen view on who exists and enters camp, even in death where spies would be obvious, they still act as if any newcomer could be an infiltrator. | They always keep several legionaries perpetually building fortifications. Many of which are pointless given the situation — from latrines to irrigation wells.} {They are always pacing around camp, ordering legionaries in charge of logistics to buy more grain. The legonaries pile the grain in the tent, but none touch it thereafter. | Upbeat even in spite of their skeletal form, %name% clearly relishes the opportunity to lead their troops once more. When moods sour and times get tough, they're the first to rally the men into a beaming fervour. | One can tell that %name% worked their way through the Legion's ranks, even if a lifetime ago. They aren't afraid to help with the donkey's work around camp or reminisce with old brothers in arms, sharing tales of their lives and deaths. | A mean streak to boot, and a taste for order that would give the Emperor pause, %name% manifests the rugged discipline of the Legion's finest. They strive for absolute excellence, and expect nothing less from their men. | %name%'s death was a mercy for both their men and the enemy. %name%\'s cruel genius exacted a heavy toll from all who dared to stand against them. Now, with a new life and mission, all will find death's mercy was but a temporary reprieve. | Fear is as alien a concept to %name% as defeat is. Their unsettlingly calm demeanour against seemingly insurmountable odds betrays them as one of the Legion's most dauntless leaders.}";
