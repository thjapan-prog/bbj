One thing led to another...%SPEECH_OFF%%They_druid% gives a weak gesture towards the conflagration before you. %SPEECH_ON%I have failed the cause of centuries.

Frankly, you\'re not sure if %they_druid% won\'t just kill %themselves_druid% right here and now. Perhaps a druid could be useful to a mercenary company?
