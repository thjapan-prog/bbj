You speak of green recruits who hadn\'t yet held steel with steady hands, of patchwork armor and borrowed blades. \n\n And then, you bring them forward. Through the trials, the battles, the losses. Through the beast-hunts, the cursed towns, the midnight escapes. You speak of the strength they\'ve earned, the names they\'ve made for themselves, and the fear they now strike in others. \n\n The fire crackles as you pause. No grand theatrics, no empty bravado, just a quiet truth shared among those who\'ve lived it. Someone raises a mug. Then another.
